# Google OAuth Status Update

## Current Debug Results ✅

Based on your debug logs, here's the current status:

### ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY:
- **Google API Load**: ✅ Success
- **Google Initialize**: ✅ Success  
- **Google Button Render**: ✅ Success

### ⚠️ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- **Google Prompt**: Skipped with "unknown_reason"

## Why the Prompt is Skipped

The prompt being "skipped" with "unknown_reason" is actually **NORMAL** and can happen when:

1. **User already interacted with Google One Tap** in this browser session
2. **Browser cached a previous dismissal** 
3. **User already signed into Google** in this browser
4. **Google's AI decides not to show One Tap** (privacy/UX reasons)

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Google Button
The Google Sign-In **button** was successfully rendered. This should work even when the prompt is skipped.

**Try clicking the Google button** on the debug page and see if:
- Google login popup appears
- You can select your Google account
- You get redirected back with credentials

### 2. Test in Fresh Browser Context
To eliminate caching issues:
- Open **incognito/private window**
- Go to `http://localhost:5173/debug.html`
- Run the tests again

### 3. Test Your Main App
Since the Google button is working, test your main app:
- Go to `http://localhost:5173` (your main app)
- Try the Google login button on your login page
- It should work now!

## What This Means

**The "unregistered_origin" error is likely FIXED!** 🎉

The fact that:
- Initialize succeeds
- Button renders successfully
- No "unregistered_origin" errors

Suggests your Google Cloud Console configuration is now working correctly.

## If Button Still Doesn't Work

If clicking the Google button doesn't work, we may need to:
1. Clear all Google-related cookies/cache
2. Try a different OAuth Client ID
3. Check Google Cloud Console project settings

But based on these logs, you're very close to having a working Google OAuth implementation!
