## Avoid Hardcoded localhost URLs

To ensure seamless deployment (e.g., to Render or Vercel), avoid hardcoding `localhost` endpoints in your API calls. Use environment variables instead.

```regex [*.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx]
http://localhost:\d+

## üñ•Ô∏è Ensure Responsive UI Across Monitors and Zoom Levels

When designing UI (especially layouts like tournament brackets), ensure elements scale well across:
- Different monitor resolutions (e.g., 1920√ó1080, 2560√ó1440, ultrawide, 1366√ó768)
- Varying browser zoom levels (e.g., 80%‚Äì150%)

```comment [*.tsx, *.jsx, *.html, *.js]

Ensure this layout uses responsive units (%, rem, vw/vh, flex/grid) instead of fixed pixels. Consider edge cases like 1366√ó768 and 2560√ó1440 with zoom.
